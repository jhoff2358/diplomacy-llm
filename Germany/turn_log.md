## Spring 1902 Analysis

### Board State
- **Vision:** I can see that **Burgundy is EMPTY** and **Belgium is Neutral**. England is in `NTH`. Russia is in `SWE`.
- **Threats:**
  - **England:** `F NTH` + `F Lon`. High naval projection. If `F Lon` moves to `ENG`, it attacks France. If it moves to `NTH` or `HEL`, it threatens me.
  - **France:** Currently in `Mar`. Low immediate threat to Munich, but if they bounce off Italy and return North, `Bur` becomes a hotspot again.

### Objectives
1. **Secure Belgium:** It is currently neutral. I have the position (`A Hol`, `A Ruh`) to take it by force.
2. **Define the English Alliance:** With `F Lon` built, England is ready for war. I must ensure that war is directed at France (Channel), not Germany (Helgoland/Holland).
3. **Exploit French Weakness:** France is fighting Italy. This is the ideal time to secure the western border or expand into it.

### Tactical Options
- **The Belgium Push:** `A Hol - Bel`, `A Ruh S A Hol - Bel`. Supports guarantees success against single-unit interference.
- **The Defensive Backfill:** `F Kie - Hol`. Protects Holland from an English stab while army moves to Belgium.
- **The Munich Pivot:** `A Mun` is the swing vote.
  - *Aggressive:* `A Mun - Bur`. If France is in Marseille, this walks into Burgundy unopposed, threatening Paris.
  - *Defensive:* `A Mun HOLD` or `A Mun - Ruh`.
- **Naval Maneuvers:** `F Den`. Holding is safe. Moving to `HEL` is aggressive toward England.
