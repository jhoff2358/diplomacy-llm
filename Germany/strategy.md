# German Grand Strategy - Spring 1902

## The "Western Sweep"
With France distracted by Italy in the south and England maneuvering for the Channel, the conditions for a decisive German expansion are met. The "Triangular Diplomacy" is resolved: **Kill France.**

## Operational Objectives
1.  **Secure Belgium:** `A Hol - Bel` supported by `A Ruh`. This is a guaranteed capture regardless of English or French interference (2v1).
2.  **Seize Burgundy:** `A Mun - Bur`.
    - France believes the DMZ holds. They plan `A Par - Pic`.
    - If successful, this move exposes Paris and Marseille to immediate threats and creates a forward defense for Munich.
    - If it bounces, we lose nothing but the element of surprise.
3.  **Defensive Layers:**
    - `F Kie - Hol`: Backfill Holland to prevent an accidental or malicious English entry from `NTH`.
    - `F Den HOLD`: Maintain the Baltic seal.

## Diplomatic Cover
- **England:** Be transparent about Belgium. Encourage their move to the Channel.
- **France:** Lie. Confirm the DMZ. Frame the moves in the north as anti-English defensive measures to secure Belgium.

## Fall 1902 Lookahead
- If `Bur` and `Bel` are taken, I will have 3 units bordering Paris and 2 bordering other French centers.
- Likely Builds: Armies.
- English Tension: Watch `F NTH`. If they take `ENG` effectively, they are a good ally. If they linger in `NTH`, they are a threat.
