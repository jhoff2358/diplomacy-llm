# Strategy Log - Turkey

## Spring 1901
**Situation Analysis:**
- Fog of War is active. I can only see adjacent to my Home SCs.
- **Critical Info:** I cannot message *anyone* at the start of the game because I do not "border" them yet according to the game state.
- This forces a unilateral opening strategy. Negotiation is impossible.

**Threat Assessment:**
- **Russia:** The Black Sea (BLA) is the critical flashpoint. Without a negotiated DMZ, I must assume Russia will try to take it to secure their southern flank. If I leave it open and they take it, they see Ank and Con and threaten my core.
- **Austria/Italy:** No immediate threat, but I need to expand toward the Balkans to gain visibility and contact.

**Moves:**
- **F Ank -> BLA:** The only safe move. Bouncing Russia is acceptable. Taking BLA gives me vision of Sevastopol and Rumania, likely enabling communication with Russia next turn.
- **A Con -> Bul:** Standard expansion. Gains a supply center and vision of Serbia, Rumania, and Greece. This should allow me to contact Austria and potentially Russia.
- **A Smy -> Con:** Backfilling Constantinople allows me to support Bulgaria in the fall or pivot defensively.

**Goals for Fall 1901:**
- Establish contact with Russia and Austria.
- Secure Bulgaria.
- Determine the status of the Black Sea.
## Fall 1901
**Situation Update:**
- **Visibility:** I successfully moved to Bulgaria (`A Con - Bul`) and backfilled Constantinople (`A Smy - Con`). I now see Serbia (occupied by Austria) and neutral Greece/Rumania.
- **Black Sea:** My move to BLA bounced (`F Ank - BLA` failed). This confirms Russia moved `F Sev - BLA`. The sea is contested.
- **Diplomacy:** I can now message **Austria** because I see their unit in Serbia. I still cannot message Russia.

**Strategic Goals:**
1.  **Secure Home:** Must bounce in BLA again. Allowing Russia into BLA gives them vision of 2/3 home centers and a convoy route.
2.  **Secure Growth:** I must hold Bulgaria to claim the supply center. Moving out risks leaving it empty or bouncing and ending up with nothing if the move succeeds.
3.  **Diplomacy:** Establish a non-aggression pact with Austria. Inform them of the Russian aggression (BLA bounce) to prove I am not in a Juggernaut alliance.

**Tactical Plan:**
- **F Ank -> BLA:** Essential defense/denial.
- **A Bul HOLD:** Secure the build.
- **A Con HOLD:** Keeps Smyrna open for a potential fleet build to contest the Aegean/Med later, or an army if needed. Cannot move to Ank (occupied) or BLA (sea).

**Planned Communication:**
- **To Austria:**
    - Acknowledge contact.
    - Reveal the BLA bounce (proof of anti-Russian stance).
    - State intent to hold Bulgaria and not advance on Serbia/Greece.
    - Encourage them to take Greece.
## Fall 1901
**Analysis:**
- **Diplomacy:** Successfully established contact with Austria. They claim to be anti-Russian (bounced in Galicia) and are focusing on Greece (supported by Serbia). This relieves pressure on Bulgaria.
- **Intelligence:**
    - Russia bounced me in BLA (`F Sev - BLA`).
    - Austria occupies Serbia (`A Ser`).
    - Austria claims to be moving `F -> Gre` supported by `A Ser`.
- **Unit Discrepancy:** The game state lists "A Turkey" in Ank, but game history confirms it functioned as a Fleet (`F Ank - BLA`). I will proceed assuming it is a Fleet.

**Strategy:**
- **Black Sea:** Must continue to contest. `F Ank - BLA` is mandatory to prevent a Russian free walk-in which would compromise my Home SCs.
- **Expansion:**
    - I have `A Bul` and `A Con`.
    - Rumania is neutral and unoccupied.
    - Moving `A Bul - Rum` allows me to potentially capture a second SC and gain critical intelligence on Russia (Sev/Ukr) and Austria (Bud/Gal).
    - Moving `A Con - Bul` backfills Bulgaria.
    - **Scenarios:**
        - *Success:* I take Rum, hold Bul. 2 Builds.
        - *Bounce:* I stay in Bul, Con stays in Con. 1 Build. Safety maintained.
    - This is a high-reward, low-risk play.

**Orders:**
- F Ank - BLA
- A Bul - Rum
- A Con - Bul
## Winter 1901
**Analysis:**
- **Success:** I occupy the Black Sea (`F BLA`). This provides security for Ankara and Constantinople and immense leverage over Russia.
- **Setback:** `A Bul - Rum` failed. Russia occupies Rumania and Sevastopol. This implies Russia likely supported `A Ukr - Rum` with `F Sev` or a similar maneuver.
- **Diplomacy:**
    - **Austria:** Friendly. Took Greece and Serbia.
    - **Russia:** Nervous. Sees `F BLA` as a threat ("knife at throat"). Proposes alliance vs Austria.

**Build Strategy:**
- I have 1 Build (4 SCs: Con, Ank, Smy, Bul).
- Options: `A Ank` (Anti-Russia), `A Smy` (Flexible), `F Smy` (Anti-Austria/Med).
- **Decision:** `BUILD F Smy`.
    - `A Ank` signals immediate war with Russia (Armenia). Given `F BLA` gives me security, I don't need to rush this war yet.
    - `F Smy` projects power into the Aegean (`AEG`). This allows me to contest Greece later or defend against an Austrian naval push. It is also the standard move for a Juggernaut (Turkey goes naval/Med, Russia goes land).
    - This build supports the narrative that I am turning south/west, placating Russia while keeping the BLA security guarantee.

**Diplomatic Approach:**
- **Russia:** Assure them `F BLA` is defensive. Promise not to build `A Ank` or move to Armenia if they focus North/West. Agree to a rough sphere of influence (me: BLA/Bul, them: Rum/Sev).
- **Austria:** Congratulate on Greece. Reaffirm non-aggression. Mention the Russian threat in Rum to keep them focused North.
## Winter 1901 - Execution
**Diplomatic Update:**
- Messages sent to both Austria and Russia confirming the "Southward/Naval" narrative.
- **Austria:** Accepted the explanation. Plans to build 2 armies to fight Russia on land. Seems trusting.
- **Russia:** Wary but accepted the proposal. Agreed to a "Sphere of Influence" deal where I hold BLA/Med and he holds Rum/Land. He is building for defense/stability.

**Confirmation:**
- I will proceed with `BUILD F Smy`.
- This order keeps the peace with Russia for now, preventing an immediate 2v1 against me.
- It allows me to pivot to the Mediterranean or backstab Austria later if the Russian war stalls.
- It maintains trust with Austria as I am not building `A Ank` or `A Smy` which could crowd the Balkans/Anatolia.

**Next Phase (Spring 1902) Preview:**
- **Diplomacy:** Must reassure Austria that `F Smy -> AEG` is not a threat to Greece.
- **Moves:** `F BLA` must hold or support. `F Smy -> AEG`. `A Bul` and `A Con` need to coordinate based on Russian builds.
# Year End Review: 1901

## The State of the Empire
- **SC Count:** 4 (Con, Ank, Smy, Bul)
- **Unit Positioning:**
  - `F BLA`: **Critical Asset.** Controls the northern flank, threatens Sev/Rum, protects Con/Ank.
  - `F Smy`: Projects power into the Med. Ambiguous purpose (can attack Gre/Italy or defend).
  - `A Bul`: Forward operating base. Threats: Ser, Rum, Gre.
  - `A Con`: Reserve. Needs to move.
- **Intelligence:**
  - **Russia:** Holds Rum, Sev. Bounced in BLA initially, now locked out. Likely fighting Austria.
  - **Austria:** Holds Ser, Gre. Aggressive expansion. Building armies (Vie/Bud). Anti-Russian.

## Strategic Assessment for 1902
1.  **The Double Game:** I have promised peace to both neighbors.
    - *To Austria:* I am the anti-Russian flank protector.
    - *To Russia:* I am the anti-Austrian/Italian naval power.
2.  **The Bottleneck:** My armies (`A Bul`, `A Con`) are stuck. I cannot expand without annoying someone.
    - `A Bul` moving to Rum angers Russia.
    - `A Bul` moving to Ser/Gre angers Austria.
3.  **The Pivot Point:** Spring 1902 is a positioning turn. Fall 1902 is the stabbing turn.
    - **Goal:** Move `F Smy -> AEG`. This gains vision of Ionian Sea (Italy?) and Greece.
    - **Goal:** Keep `F BLA`. Never negotiate this away.
    - **Goal:** Determine the weaker neighbor.
        - If Austria smashes Russia in Galicia: **Stab Austria** (take Gre/Ser).
        - If Russia smashes Austria (takes Bud/Vie): **Stab Russia** (Convoy to Sev).
        - If they stalemate: **Pick a side** (likely Russia, as Juggernaut is stronger in Fog).

## Spring 1902 Plan
- **Moves:**
  - `F Smy -> AEG`: Essential for vision and flexibility.
  - `F BLA HOLD`: Maintain the lock.
  - `A Bul`: Likely support Austria into Rum *OR* Hold to see what happens.
  - `A Con`: Move to `Bul` (if Bul moves) or `Smy` (to convoy later).
- **Diplomacy:**
  - **Austria:** Ask for their build info. Propose a joint attack on Rumania (A Bul S A Ser/Gal -> Rum).
  - **Russia:** Reiterate the "Med Focus." Explain `F Smy -> AEG` as anti-Italian. Ask for a DMZ in Armenia to keep the peace.
## Spring 1902 Strategy
**The Decision:** Support Austria.
- **Reasoning:**
    - Austria built Armies (Anti-Russia).
    - Russia holds Rum/Sev and contests BLA.
    - A stalemate hurts me.
    - Helping Austria clears Rumania of Russian influence, removing the immediate threat to Bulgaria.
- **Risks:**
    - Austria becomes too strong (6 SCs).
    - Russia becomes an eternal enemy.
- **Mitigation:**
    - I hold `F BLA`. Austria cannot easily attack me there.
    - I move `F Smy - AEG` to check Austrian naval expansion.
    - I demand Sevastopol as my share of the spoils.

**Orders:**
- `F BLA HOLD`: Secure the North.
- `A Bul S A Bud - Rum`: The Deal.
- `F Smy - AEG`: Expansion/Vision.
- `A Con - Smy`: Mobilize reserve to the coast.

**Diplomacy:**
- **Austria:** Confirm the deal.
- **Russia:** Lie. Claim defensive posturing.
