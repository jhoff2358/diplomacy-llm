# Diplomatic Ledger - Spring 1902

## AUSTRIA-HUNGARY
**Status:** ALLY
**Current Narrative:** "Joint Crusade against Russia."
**The Truth:** I am enabling Austria to become a superpower to break the deadlock. I risk creating a monster, but the Russian threat in Rum/Sev/BLA is too immediate.
**Action Items:**
- Execute `A Bul S A Bud - Rum`.
- Secure agreement that Sevastopol is Turkish.
- Monitor Austrian builds next winter. If he builds Fleets, panic.

## RUSSIA
**Status:** DECEPTION / TARGET
**Current Narrative:** "Tense Peace / Southern Focus."
**The Truth:** I am about to stab him by supporting Austria into Rumania.
**Action Items:**
- Send reassuring message about moving to Med.
- Lull him into not cutting the support from Bulgaria.
