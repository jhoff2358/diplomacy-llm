# Spring 1902 Order Strategy

## The Russian Deception (Galicia)
*   **Context:** Russia requested a DMZ in Galicia.
*   **Action:** I will agree to it diplomatically.
*   **Order:** `A Vie - Gal`.
*   **Rationale:** Trusting Russia is fatal here. If he honors it, I gain the most critical territory on the board. If he lies (attacks Gal), we bounce and I lose nothing. If I honor it and he attacks, I lose Vienna/Budapest potential.

## The Rumanian Offensive
*   **Context:** Russia occupies Rumania. It is a salient threatening my entire home.
*   **Action:** Full commitment attack.
*   **Orders:**
    *   `A Bud - Rum`
    *   `A Ser S A Bud - Rum`
*   **Diplomacy:** Request `A Bul S A Bud - Rum` from Turkey.
    *   *Math:* 
        *   My strength: 2 (Bud + Ser).
        *   Likely Russian Defense: 2 (Rum + S from Sev/Ukr).
        *   With Turkish Support: 3. **Dislodgement achieved.**

## The Greek Pivot (Defense)
*   **Context:** Italy has `F Nap` + `F ION`. Turkey has `F Smy`.
*   **Order:** `F Gre Holds`.
*   **Rationale:** Moving to ION provokes Italy. Moving to AEG provokes Turkey. Holding preserves the unit for Fall convoying or defense.

## Final Orders
*   A Vienna -> Galicia
*   A Budapest -> Rumania
*   A Serbia SUPPORT A Budapest -> Rumania
*   F Greece HOLD
