# Year 1901 Review

## Summary
The first year has established a rigid East-West split. I have successfully integrated with the Southern/Mediterranean sphere (friendly relations with Italy and Turkey) but am locked in a stalemate in the North (hostile Russia).

## Successes
1.  **Securing Greece:** Taking Greece in Fall 1901 without conflict was a major win. It provides a build and a forward naval base.
2.  **Italian Non-Aggression:** Italy kept his word. Tyrolia and the Adriatic are confirmed empty. He has not moved against Trieste.
3.  **Turkish Detente:** Turkey claims to be anti-Russian. He allowed me to take Greece and did not bounce me in Serbia.

## Failures
1.  **Galicia:** Two attempts to enter Galicia bounced. This suggests Russia is prioritizing the Austrian front over all else.
2.  **Rumania:** Russia secured Rumania. This creates a dangerous salient into my defense (bordering Bud/Ser/Gal).

## The "Confirmed Empty" Insight
Per the new rules clarification, I know for a fact that:
- **Tyrolia is empty.** Italy did not sneak in.
- **Adriatic is empty.** Italy is not setting up a convoy landing in Trieste/Albania yet.
- **Galicia is empty.** Russia did not move in during the Winter (obviously) and no retreat happened there.

## Outlook for 1902
I must break the Russian line. A static war benefits Russia (who has room to expand in the north) more than me. I need to dislodge him from Rumania or force him into a defensive crouch while I convince Turkey to stab him.
