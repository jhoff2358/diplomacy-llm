# Diplomatic Tracker - Spring 1902

## RUSSIA (Hostile)
*   **Assessment:** Dangerous. He holds Rumania and keeps hitting Galicia.
*   **Current Narrative:** We are discussing a DMZ in Galicia.
*   **The Lie:** I will agree to the DMZ in correspondence.
*   **The Truth:** I will attack Galicia (`Vie -> Gal`).
    *   *Reasoning:* If I honor the DMZ and he lies, he walks into Galicia and I am encircled. If I attack and he honors it, I gain the strategic high ground. If we both attack, we bounce (status quo). The risk of trusting him is too high.

## TURKEY (Ally of Convenience)
*   **Assessment:** Essential. I cannot fight Russia alone.
*   **Requests:**
    1.  Confirm `F BLA` existence.
    2.  Ask for `A Bul` to **Support** `A Bud -> Rum`.
        *   *Note:* If he supports me, I take Rum. If he attacks Rum himself, we might bounce Russia (2v2) or he takes it. I prefer I take it, but dislodging Russia is the priority.
    3.  Ask `F Smy` to move to `EMS` (to harass Italy/Egypt) or `AEG` (to convoy later). I need to ensure `F Smy` isn't coming for Greece.

## ITALY (Neutral / Threat)
*   **Assessment:** A ticking clock. `F Nap` + `F ION` is a fleet heavy build.
*   **Strategy:** Misdirection.
    *   Reinforce the "Russian Threat" narrative to justify my builds.
    *   Feed him fear about Turkey. "Turkey built a fleet in Smyrna; he is coming for the Med."
    *   Goal: Keep `A Ven` West or holding. Keep fleets moving toward Tunis/Egypt.
