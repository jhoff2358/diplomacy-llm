# Strategic Plan: Spring 1902

## Operational Goals
1.  **Break the Northern Stalemate:** Control Galicia.
2.  **Contest Rumania:** Dislodge Russia or force him to burn supports.
3.  **Secure the South:** Ensure Italy/Turkey do not stab while I fight north.

## Tactical Analysis & Orders

### The "Galician Gambit"
Russia requested a DMZ. I will violate it.
*   **Order:** `A Vie - Gal`
*   *Contingencies:*
    *   Russia `War - Gal`: Bounce. (No loss).
    *   Russia Holds/DMZs: I take Galicia. (Huge win).

### The "Rumanian Push"
Russia is likely to defend Rumania with `F Sev` (if it exists) and `A War` (cutting Gal).
*   **Order:** `A Bud - Rum`
*   **Order:** `A Ser S A Bud - Rum`
*   *Diplomatic Coordination:* Request Turkey `A Bul S A Bud - Rum`.
    *   *Calculation:* 
        *   My strength: 2 (Bud + Ser).
        *   Possible Russian defense: 2 (Rum + Sev).
        *   If Turkey supports: 3 vs 2. **Success.**
        *   If Turkey cuts support (attacks Rum): 2 vs 2 (Bounce).
        *   If Turkey stabs (attacks Ser): Support cut. 1 vs 2. **Fail.**

### The "Greek Shield"
Italy has fleets in ION and NAP. Turkey has a fleet in SMY. Greece is the pivot.
*   **Order:** `F Gre Holds`
*   *Reasoning:* Moving to AEG is aggressive toward Turkey. Moving to ION is aggressive toward Italy (and suicidal). Holding is the safest play. It protects the center and keeps options open for Fall.

## Summary of Orders
*   **A Vienna -> Galicia**
*   **A Budapest -> Rumania**
*   **A Serbia SUPPORT A Budapest -> Rumania**
*   **F Greece HOLD**
