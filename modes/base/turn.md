**YOUR TURN**

React to recent events. Send messages to other powers if needed.

**SCRATCHPAD:** Jot down quick notes as you go. This is a temporary scratchpad - just capture reactions, ideas, and anything you want to remember. Don't worry about organization; you'll structure your thoughts during reflect.

<NOTE>Your thoughts here...</NOTE>

If you have nothing to add this round (no notes, no messages), simply respond with **DONE** to end your turn early.
