**YOUR TURN**

React to recent events. Send messages to other powers if needed.
Write your thoughts to void.md - this is your scratchpad for the season.

{block:file_management}

{block:messaging_instructions}

**RESTRICTIONS:**
- You can ONLY write to void.md in this phase (messages are separate)
- No orders yet - those come during reflect

If you have nothing to add right now, simply respond with **PASS**.
