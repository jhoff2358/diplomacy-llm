**TURN PHASE** — You'll have a REFLECT phase later to organize your thoughts and submit orders.

React to recent events. You can send messages, but only if you have something specific to say.

**SCRATCHPAD:** Jot down quick notes as you go. Don't worry about organization - you'll structure everything during reflect.

<NOTE>Your thoughts here...</NOTE>

If you have nothing to add this round, respond with **DONE**.
