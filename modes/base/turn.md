First, briefly react to what happened last season (or the current board state if this is the start). What surprised you? What went as expected? How does this change your thinking?

Then decide what to do this turn. You may send messages, update your notes, or both.

If you have nothing to add right now, simply respond with **PASS** - there's no need to act on every turn.
