**TURN PHASE** — Execute on your plan from debrief. You'll have a REFLECT phase later to submit orders.

Check your void.md for the plan you made during debrief. What did you want to accomplish? Who did you need to talk to?

Stay reactive — if someone brings up something you hadn't considered, engage with it. But keep your strategic goals in mind.

**SCRATCHPAD:** Add notes as you go.

<NOTE>Your thoughts here...</NOTE>

If you have nothing to add this round, respond with **DONE**.
