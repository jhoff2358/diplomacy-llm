## PART 1: LEARN FROM LAST SEASON

Look at the game history to see what just happened. Focus on:
- Which of your orders failed? Why?
- Were there any surprises?
- Did any diplomatic promises get broken?
- Are there patterns emerging?

**Update your lessons_learned.md with specific, actionable lessons:**

<FILE name="lessons_learned.md" mode="append">
## [Category]
- [Specific lesson]
</FILE>

**Categories to consider:**
- **Movement Rules** - adjacency errors, convoy requirements, fleet/army restrictions
- **Contested Territories** - places that consistently bounce
- **Diplomatic Patterns** - who keeps promises, who betrays
- **Failed Tactics** - approaches that didn't work

## PART 2: PLAN THIS SEASON

Now think ahead. What do you want to accomplish this season?

Consider:
- What are your strategic priorities?
- What information do you need from other powers?
- Who do you need to talk to, and about what?
- Are there deals you want to propose or renegotiate?

**Write your plan to void.md:**

<NOTE>
My priorities this season:
- [Goal 1]

I need to:
- Talk to [Country] about [topic]
- Find out if [Country] will [action]
- Propose [deal] to [Country]
