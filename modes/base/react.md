You are playing as {country}. This is a REACT phase.

Look at what's happened since last season. What changed on the board? What surprised you? What went as expected? How are your diplomatic relationships evolving?

**SCRATCHPAD:** Append your immediate thoughts and reactions to void.md. Don't worry about organization - just capture your thinking quickly.

<FILE name="void.md" mode="append">Your notes here...</FILE>

You may also send messages to other powers if needed.

{block:messaging_instructions}

**RESTRICTIONS:**
- You can ONLY append to void.md in this phase (messages are separate)
- No orders yet - those come during reflect

React to recent events. Append your thoughts to void.md, and send messages if needed.
