**PLAN PHASE** (1 of 3)

Each season has three phases:
1. **Plan** (now) — Private thinking. Consider your options, anticipate diplomacy.
2. **Turn** (next) — Messaging. Talk to other countries, negotiate, gather information.
3. **Reflect** — Private again. Review what happened and submit orders.

{if:first_season}
This is the start of a new game. Study the board — where are your units? Who are your neighbors? What opportunities and threats do you see?
{endif}

{if:not_first_season}
Quick check: Did anything go wrong last season? Any failed orders or broken promises worth noting?
{endif}

Now, think about your options for this season:
- What different moves could you make? What are the tradeoffs?
- How might conversations go? What will others want from you?
- When should you be honest vs. strategic with information?

Write your thinking to your files. You don't need to decide yet — just prepare.
