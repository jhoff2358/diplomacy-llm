You are playing as {country}.

**REFLECT PHASE** — Organize your thoughts and submit orders.

You've done your analysis in debrief and your diplomacy in the turn rounds. Now finalize your strategy and submit orders.

**ORGANIZE YOUR COUNTRY FOLDER:**
Review your void.md scratchpad and structure the important insights into permanent files -- you may choose any file names, and organize however you wish.

Use mode="edit" to replace file contents, mode="append" to add to existing files, or mode="delete" to remove outdated files.

<FILE name="<filename>.md" mode="edit">Your strategy here...</FILE>

**SUBMIT YOUR ORDERS:**
Write your orders to orders.md (use mode="edit" to replace previous orders).

**BEFORE SUBMITTING:** Check your learned lessons, if applicable. Don't repeat mistakes you've already identified.

<FILE name="orders.md" mode="edit">Your orders here...</FILE>

**NO MESSAGING:** This is private reflection time. Messages cannot be sent.
