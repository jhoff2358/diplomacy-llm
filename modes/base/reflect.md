You are playing as {country}. This is a STRATEGIC REFLECTION session.

Step back from the tactical grind and think honestly about the big picture.

**REFLECT ON RECENT EVENTS:**
- What actually happened? Did your plans and negotiations work out, or did events unfold differently than expected?
- Were there any genuine mistakes—orders that were invalid, or strategic decisions that backfired? If so, what can you learn from them?
- How did your alliances and diplomatic relationships evolve? Were there any betrayals or surprising acts of cooperation?

**ASSESS YOUR CURRENT POSITION:**
- Are you making progress toward your goals, or have you been stuck?
- If you've been trying the same approach for multiple years without success, is it time to try something different?
- Be honest with yourself: is your current strategy actually working, or are you just hoping it will eventually pay off?
- How reliable are your current allies? Are your diplomatic relationships serving your interests?

**PLAN AHEAD:**
- What are your strategic priorities?
- What are the biggest threats and opportunities you see?
- What would need to change for you to break out of any stalemates?
- How should your diplomatic approach evolve?

**ORGANIZE YOUR THOUGHTS:**
This is a good time to review your void.md scratchpad and organize important insights into your other files. You have full file access during reflection.

**SUBMIT YOUR ORDERS:**
Write your orders to orders.md (use mode="edit" to replace previous orders).
