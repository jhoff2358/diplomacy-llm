You are playing as {country}.

**REFLECT PHASE** — Organize your thoughts and submit orders.

You've done your analysis in debrief and your diplomacy in the turn rounds. Now finalize your strategy and submit orders.

**ORGANIZE YOUR COUNTRY FOLDER:**
Review your void.md scratchpad and structure the important insights into permanent files:
- **strategy.md** - Your current strategic plan and priorities
- **allies.md** - Assessment of relationships with other powers
- **threats.md** - Key threats and how to address them

Use mode="edit" to replace file contents, mode="append" to add to existing files, or mode="delete" to remove outdated files.

<FILE name="strategy.md" mode="edit">Your strategy here...</FILE>

**SUBMIT YOUR ORDERS:**
Write your orders to orders.md (use mode="edit" to replace previous orders).

**BEFORE SUBMITTING:** Check your lessons_learned.md if it exists. Don't repeat mistakes you've already identified.

<FILE name="orders.md" mode="edit">Your orders here...</FILE>

**NO MESSAGING:** This is private reflection time. Messages cannot be sent.
