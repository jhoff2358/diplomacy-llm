**YOUR TURN**

First, briefly react to what happened last season (or the current board state if this is the start). What surprised you? What went as expected? How does this change your thinking?

Then, analyze the board and submit your orders:
1. Update your notes with your strategic thinking
2. Write your orders to orders.md (use mode="edit" to replace previous orders)
