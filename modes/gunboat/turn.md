**YOUR TURN**

React to recent events.

**SCRATCHPAD:** Append quick notes to void.md as you go. This is a temporary scratchpad - just jot down reactions, ideas, and anything you want to remember. Don't worry about organization; you'll structure your thoughts during reflect.

<FILE name="void.md" mode="append">Your notes here...</FILE>

**RESTRICTIONS:**
- You can ONLY append to void.md in this phase
- No orders yet - those come during reflect
- No messaging (gunboat mode)
