You are playing as {country}. This is a REACT phase.

Look at what's happened since last season. What changed on the board? What surprised you? What went as expected?

**SCRATCHPAD:** Append your immediate thoughts and reactions to void.md. Don't worry about organization - just capture your thinking quickly.

<FILE name="void.md" mode="append">Your notes here...</FILE>

Then submit your orders for this season:

<FILE name="orders.md" mode="edit">Your orders here...</FILE>

**RESTRICTIONS:**
- You can ONLY append to void.md and write orders.md in this phase
- No messaging (gunboat mode)
