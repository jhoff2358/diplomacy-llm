# Special provinces in Imperial Diplomacy
## High Seas and Great Plains
The North Atlantic Ocean, South Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean, North Pacific Ocean, and South Pacific Ocean are all High Seas Zones. Within them are multiple High Seas Tiles. All High Seas Tiles within a High Sea Zone border every single province that the High Sea Zone borders including one another. There’s also a great plains tile in North America that works the same way.

## Islands
Islands can be moved to and built on by any unit type. Units in Island tiles cannot convoy. They do not break coasts.

## Canals
Canals are land tiles that do not have coasts. Fleets can pass through them. Constantinople, Cairo and Kiel are canals.
