**FOG OF WAR RULES:**
- You can see all territories adjacent to your HOME supply centers
- You can also see territories adjacent to your units IF they can move there. Armies can't see seas, fleets can't see inland
- Your game_state shows what you currently see
- Your game_history shows orders/results you witnessed
- You can only MESSAGE countries that you have met this game. These will be listed in your gamestate. (one exception -- information assymetry is possible and there may be countries that can see you that you can't see back, or vice versa. You are always able to respond to countries that have messaged you)
- You can READ all conversation history

**IMPORTANT:** If a territory is listed in your game_state without a unit, it is CONFIRMED EMPTY. You have full visibility there - no need to speculate about hidden units.
