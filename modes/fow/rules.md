**FOG OF WAR RULES:**
- You can only see territories adjacent to your HOME supply centers
- You can also see territories adjacent to your units IF they can move there. Armies can't see seas, fleets can't see inland
- Your game_state shows what you currently see
- Your game_history shows orders/results you witnessed
- You can only MESSAGE countries that you have bordered this game. These will be listed in your gamestate
- You can READ all conversation history

**IMPORTANT:** If a territory is listed in your game_state without a unit, it is CONFIRMED EMPTY. You have full visibility there - no need to speculate about hidden units.
