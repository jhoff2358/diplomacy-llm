# Strategy Log - France

## Spring 1901
**Status:**
- No communications allowed yet (No bordering countries visible).
- Goals: Secure neutral SCs (Spain, Portugal), establish vision of neighbors, protect home centers.

**Fog of War Considerations:**
- Vision is key. Moving to Burgundy (Bur) provides vision of German units in Ruhr/Munich/Belgium.
- Moving to MAO provides vision of English/Italian naval movements in the Atlantic/Med.
- Leaving Burgundy open invites Germany to enter and gain vision of *my* interior (Paris/Marseille).

**Planned Orders:**
- **F Bre -> MAO**: Standard expansion. Sets up for Por/Spa. Grants vision of NAO, IRI, WES, Naf.
- **A Par -> Bur**: Defensive/Intel move. If I bounce Germany, we are safe. If I succeed, I see their units and threaten/negotiate from strength. Denies them vision of my interior.
- **A Mar -> Spa**: Secure Spain.

**Diplomatic Stance:**
- Isolated. Will likely establish contact with Germany (via Bur), England (via MAO), and potentially Italy (via Spa/Mar) after this turn.
## Fall 1901
**Status:**
- Visible: A Italy in Piedmont (Pie). Germany in Ruhr (Ruh).
- Home: Mar is open. A Spa is in Spain. A Bur is in Burgundy. F MAO in Mid-Atlantic.
- Threat: A Pie threatens Mar. If I lose Mar, I lose a build and a home center.
- Builds: Currently holding 3 Home. Occupying Spa (needs to hold or bounce). Can take Por with Fleet. Aiming for +2 builds.

**Diplomatic Stance:**
- **Italy:** A Pie is hostile. Must assume attack on Mar. Need to message and warn/negotiate.
- **Germany:** A Ruh + Mun visible. Need to smooth over A Bur. Will claim it was for vision (true). Need to check if they want Belgium or if we can agree on DMZ Bur.

**Tactical Options:**
- **Objective:** Secure Por and Spa (2 builds), Defend Mar, Maintain/Resolve Bur.
- **Mar Defense:**
    - *Option A (A Spa -> Mar):* If Italy attacks, we bounce, I keep Spain, Mar safe. If Italy doesn't attack, I leave Spain empty (lose build).
    - *Option B (A Bur -> Mar):* If Italy attacks, we bounce. I stay in Bur, Mar safe, Spa safe. (Best Outcome). If Italy doesn't attack, I move to Mar, losing Bur position to potential German advance, but secure 2 builds.
    - *Selection:* Option B seems superior for growth. It guarantees 2 builds. The risk is losing Burgundy to Germany.

**Planned Orders:**
- F MAO -> Por
- A Spa Holds
- A Bur -> Mar (Bounce protection for Mar)
## Fall 1901 (Execution Phase)
**Tactical Analysis:**
- **Goal:** Secure +2 Builds (Spa, Por) and Defend Mar.
- **Dilemma:** A Pie (Italy) threatens Mar. A Bur (France) threatens Germany but is needed to cover Mar.
- **Solution:** Move A Bur -> Mar.
  - If Italy attacks Mar: Bounce (1v1). Mar saved. A Spa holds Spa. +2 Builds.
  - If Italy does not attack: A Bur -> Mar succeeds. A Spa holds Spa. +2 Builds.
  - *Risk:* Bur is left empty. Germany might move in.
  - *Mitigation:* Diplomatic message to Germany explaining the move is forced by Italy. If Germany takes Bur, he declares war, but I will have 5 units vs his 3-4 next year.

**Diplomacy:**
- **Germany:** Inform him I am vacating Bur to defend Mar against Italy. Ask him to respect DMZ.
- **Italy:** Acknowledge his message. Don't reveal the bounce order explicitly, just say I am securing my centers.

**Orders:**
- F MAO - Por
- A Spa Holds
- A Bur - Mar
## Winter 1901 (Build Phase)
**Status:**
- **Centers:** 5 (Par, Bre, Mar, Spa, Por).
- **Units:** 3.
- **Builds:** 2.
- **Locations:** Only Par and Bre are open. Mar is occupied by my own army.

**Diplomatic Analysis:**
- **Italy:** Kept his word and did not attack Mar. A Pie is still there acting as a "sentry". I cannot build in Mar, which de-escalates the immediate threat of a fleet build there. I need to encourage him to move A Pie away in Spring 1902.
- **Germany:** Contact lost. I vacated Bur as promised. I must assume he held the DMZ. If he didn't, he is in Bur now (hidden). Building A Par is critical to cover this risk.
- **England:** No contact. F Bre is necessary to secure the Channel or MAO.

**Build Strategy:**
- **Paris:** Must build **Army**. Defense against potential German betrayal in Bur or English landing in Pic.
- **Brest:** Must build **Fleet**. Projects power into MAO to support F Por, or into ENG to counter England.
- **Marseille:** Occupied. No build possible.

**Orders:**
- Build A Par
- Build F Bre
## Winter 1901 (Build Phase)
**Status:**
- **Communication:** Lost contact with Germany after vacating Burgundy. Can only speak to Italy.
- **Builds:** +2 (Total 5 SCs).
- **Constraints:** Mar is occupied by A Mar.

**Decisions:**
- **Build A Par:** Critical defensive measure. Since I cannot see Burgundy, I must prepare for the possibility that Germany moved in. If they didn't, A Par is still useful for projecting power into Bur/Pic/Gas in Spring.
- **Build F Bre:** Standard naval play. Needed for MAO or ENG control.

**Looking Ahead (Spring 1902):**
- **Italy:** If A Pie moves away as discussed, the border is secure. I can look to move A Mar -> Gas or Bur depending on the German situation.
- **Germany:** I need to verify if Bur is empty.
  - *Scenario A:* Bur is empty. Germany respected DMZ. I can try to re-establish contact by moving A Par -> Pic or Bur (though Bur might scare him again).
  - *Scenario B:* Germany is in Bur. This is an act of war. A Par defends Par. A Mar supports or defends.
- **England:** F Bre will give vision of ENG. If England is there, I have a decision to make.
# Spring 1902 Strategy

## Situation Analysis
- **Germany**: Respected the Burgundy DMZ. Bur is confirmed empty. Relations are stable.
- **Italy**: Kept A Pie in place. Built F Nap. The threat to Marseille persists, but he promised to demilitarize Pie if I built North. I have built North (Par, Bre).
- **England**: ENG and MAO are confirmed empty. This is a massive opportunity to seize the English Channel before England can lock it down.

## Operational Plan
- **The Northern Front (England):**
  - **F Bre -> ENG**: Seize the Channel. If successful, this creates an immediate threat to London and prevents English invasion.
  - **F Por -> MAO**: Secure the Mid-Atlantic. Connects the fleet network.
  - **A Par -> Pic**: Moves an army to the coast, ready for a potential convoy to Wales or London in the Fall, or to support operations in Belgium/Burgundy if things change.

## The Southern Front (Italy):
- **Defensive Posture**:
  - **A Mar Holds**: Cannot risk moving out while A Pie is adjacent.
  - **A Spa Supports A Mar**: This creates a defensive strength of 2 in Marseille. Even if Italy attacks with A Pie, he fails. If he managed to sneak a support unit adjacent (unlikely in Fog), 2 is still a strong defense.
  - *Diplomacy*: Demand Italy move A Pie as agreed. If he moves to Tyrolia or Venice, relations normalize. If he stays, he is an enemy.

## Diplomatic Objectives
- **Italy**: Confirm he sees my Northern builds. Pressure him to vacate Piedmont.
- **Germany**: Re-affirm the Burgundy DMZ. Share intel that I am moving on England. Propose a split of English centers/Belgium.
## Spring 1902 Strategy
**Status:**
- **Home:** Bre (F), Par (A), Mar (A).
- **Conquest:** Spa (A), Por (F).
- **Vision:** Bur is empty. Pie has A Italy.

**Diplomatic Insight:**
- **Germany:** Trust is building. Bur was empty. I will move A Par -> Pic to threaten England/Belgium but avoid Bur to maintain the DMZ.
- **Italy:** Waiting for him to leave Pie. I must defend Mar with A Spa S A Mar just in case he betrays me.

**Orders:**
- **F Bre -> ENG**: Vital to secure the channel before England.
- **F Por -> MAO**: Connects the fleet line.
- **A Par -> Pic**: Moves toward the front (England/Belgium) without violating Bur DMZ.
- **A Mar Holds**: Defensive anchor.
- **A Spa S A Mar**: Defensive support. Ensures Mar holds against A Pie or even A Pie + Fleet support.
