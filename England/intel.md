# Intelligence Ledger - England

## GERMANY
**Status:** Friendly / High Trust
-   **Visuals:** `F Den`, `A Hol`. (Inferred: `A Mun`, `Kie` unit).
-   **Diplomacy:** Communicative. Agreed to spheres of influence (they took Hol, we took Nwy). Shared intel that France moved away from Burgundy.
-   **Threat:** Low immediate threat. `F Den` is the only unit that can hurt us (via NTH or SKA), but they seem focused on land expansion.

## RUSSIA
**Status:** Neutral / Cautious
-   **Visuals:** `A StP`, `F Swe`.
-   **Diplomacy:** Wary. Questioned our move to Nwy. Agreed to BAR DMZ. Warned us about `A StP` build (claimed defensive).
-   **Threat:** Moderate. They have the units to attack Norway (`A StP`, `F Swe`). If they break the BAR DMZ with a fleet build or move, it's total war.

## FRANCE
**Status:** Unknown / Potential Hostile
-   **Visuals:** NONE.
-   **Diplomacy:** SILENCE.
-   **Threat:** High. The lack of communication is the most dangerous factor on the board. We must assume `F Bre` or `A Pic` might move for the Channel.

## SCANDINAVIA
-   **Nwy:** English (Occupied by Army).
-   **Swe:** Russian (Occupied by Fleet).
-   **Den:** German (Occupied by Fleet).
-   **Fin:** Empty (Visible via StP/Swe inference).
