# England Strategy - 1902

## Strategic Objectives
1.  **Illuminate the West:** Force entry into the English Channel (ENG) to determine French disposition. This is the highest priority for the new fleet.
2.  **Fortress Norway:** Maintain Norway against potential Russian aggression (A StP/F Swe). Losing Norway means losing visibility on Russia.
3.  **Diplomatic Stability:** Ensure Germany remains friendly so the eastern flank of the Home Isles (NTH) remains secure.

## Spring 1902 Orders Plan

### The French Front
-   **Move:** `F Lon - ENG`
-   **Rationale:** Vital for intel. If we succeed, we can influence Brest or Belgium in the Fall. If we bounce, we know France is hostile and we have defended London.

### The Russian Front
-   **Defense:** Russia has Strength 2 on Norway (`A StP` + `F Swe`).
-   **Move:** `A Nwy Holds`
-   **Support:** `F NWG S A Nwy`
-   **Support:** `F NTH S A Nwy`
-   **Rationale:** Total defensive strength: 3. This mathematically guarantees Norway holds against any Russian attack. It also signals to Germany that we are not attacking Belgium.

### The German Front
-   **Diplomacy:** Inform them that `F NTH` is occupied with northern defense, effectively ceding Belgium to them for this season (or at least confirming we won't contest it).

## Contingencies
-   **If F Lon bounces:** Prepare for war with France. Build armies in Winter.
-   **If Russia attacks:** They will fail. We use the aggression as justification to break the BAR DMZ next turn.
