# Strategic Log: Italy

## 1901 Review
### Summary
- **Expansion**: Successful. Gained Tunis. 4 SCs total.
- **Austria**: Established a strong alliance. DMZ in Tyrolia held. We coordinated fleets (him to Greece, me to Tunis/ION). He has left Trieste empty (verified), signaling high trust.
- **France**: Tense but managed. My move to Piedmont caused alarm, but we de-escalated. He blocked his own build in Marseille with `A Mar`, ensuring no southern French fleet. I promised to vacate Piedmont if he built North.

### Key Decisions
- **Opening**: `A Ven - Pie`, `F Nap - ION`. Allowed scouting of France and securing the Ionian.
- **Diplomacy**: Committed to Austria. Placated France.
- **Build**: `F Nap`. Signals commitment to the Mediterranean naval theater.

## 1902 Strategic Outlook

### The Dilemma of Piedmont
- **Situation**: I promised France I would vacate Piedmont (`A Pie`) if he built North. He claims `A Par` and `F Bre`.
- **The Risk**: Moving `A Pie -> Ven` or `Tus` leaves me blind to Marseille. In Fog of War, losing vision on a border unit (`A Mar`) is dangerous.
- **The Play**: I need to negotiate a simultaneous withdrawal or verification. If I hold, I break my word. If I move, I go blind.
- **Option**: Move `A Pie -> Ven`. This covers Venice (my home SC) against any Austrian treachery or French breakthrough, and fulfills the diplomatic promise. It exposes the border, but `F Nap` can cover the Tyrrhenian Sea.

### The Austrian Alliance (The Lepanto)
- **Status**: Strong.
- **Opportunity**: With `F Nap` and `F ION`, I am perfectly positioned for a Lepanto opening against Turkey.
- **Moves**:
  - `F ION -> EAS` (East Med)
  - `F Nap -> ION`
  - `A Tun` Hold (Prepare for convoy to Syria/Smyrna in Fall)
- **Benefit**: Cripples Turkey early, secures the Med, keeps Austria happy and focused on Russia.

### The Stab Option (Anti-Austria)
- **Target**: Trieste is empty.
- **Moves**: `A Pie -> Ven`, `F ION -> ADR`, `F Nap -> ION`.
- **Analysis**: Tempting, but premature. Gaining Trieste gains 1 SC but opens a war with Austria while France is still a potential threat. Better to grow off Turkey first.

## Spring 1902 Plan
1. **Diplomacy**: 
   - Confirm Austrian builds (assume armies). Reaffirm anti-Turkish stance.
   - Tell France I am moving `A Pie -> Ven` to honor the deal, but ask for confirmation that `A Mar` will not move East.
2. **Orders**:
   - `F ION - EAS`
   - `F Nap - ION`
   - `A Pie - Ven` (Safety + Promise keeping)
   - `A Tun H`
