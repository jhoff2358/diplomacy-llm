# Russian Strategic Command - 1902

## 1. The Strategic Situation (Start of Year)
**Supply Centers:** 6 (Mos, StP, Sev, War, Rum, Swe)
**Units:** 
- **North:** F Swe, A Stp
- **Center:** A War, A Mos
- **South:** F Sev, A Rum

## 2. Threat Assessment
*   **HIGH:** Turkey (F BLA). Controls the Black Sea. Can strike Sev or Rum at will.
*   **MEDIUM:** England (A Nwy). Threatens StP. Neutralized by A Stp for now.
*   **MEDIUM:** Austria (A Bud, A Ser). Rival for the Balkans.
*   **LOW:** Germany (F Den). Benevolent neutral in the Baltic.

## 3. Diplomatic Dossier
*   **Turkey:** Claims anti-Austrian stance. Claims `F Smy` build (Unverified). **Strategy:** Trust but Verify. Assume `F BLA` is hostile until proven otherwise. Do not antagonize.
*   **Austria:** Proposed DMZ `Gal` for Spring 1902. **Strategy:** Accept verbally. Use the DMZ to reposition for maximum flexibility.
*   **England:** Agreed to DMZ `BAR`. **Strategy:** Defend StP passively. Do not move `A Stp` unless Nwy moves away.
*   **Germany:** Agreed to Baltic Status Quo. **Strategy:** Keep `F Swe` defensive. Do not move to BAL.

## 4. Operational Plan: Spring 1902

### The Southern Front (The Priority)
I must assume Turkey might attack `Sev` or `Rum`.
*   **A Mos -> Ukr**: This is the critical move. From Ukraine, the Army can:
    *   Support `Rum` (defense or attack).
    *   Support `Sev` (defense).
    *   Support `War` (defense).
    *   Strike `Gal`.
*   **F Sev -> Hold/Support**: Must hold the line. Cannot dislodge BLA alone.
*   **A Rum -> Hold**: Vital chokepoint.

### The Center
*   **A War**: If I agree to DMZ Gal, I cannot move there.
    *   *Option A (Aggressive):* Move `Gal` anyway. Breaks trust with Austria immediately.
    *   *Option B (Defensive):* Hold. Wastes a unit.
    *   *Option C (Pivot):* Move `Sil`? Agresses Germany. Bad.
    *   *Option D (Shuffle):* Move `Ukr`? Clashes with `A Mos`.
    *   *Decision:* If I trust Turkey, I should stab Austria. But I don't trust Turkey yet.
    *   *Revised Plan:* Move `A War -> Mos`? No, too passive.
    *   *Recommendation:* **A War -> Ukr** and **A Mos -> Sev**? No, `Mos` is new.
    *   Let's stick to **A War -> Gal**? No, Austria offered DMZ.
    *   **A War -> Ukr** (and `A Mos -> Sev`). This puts 2 units on Sev/Rum defense.
    *   *Actually:* **A Mos -> Ukr** is best. **A War** holds or supports.

### The Northern Front
*   **A Stp -> Hold**: Mandatory counter to `A Nwy`.
*   **F Swe -> Hold**: Maintains Swedish SC. Moving to `BAL` angers Germany. Moving to `Nwy` angers England. Moving to `Fin/BOT` is retreating.

## 5. Critical Questions for Spring
1.  Did Turkey build `F Smy`? (Will see in Spring results).
2.  Does Austria respect the Gal DMZ?
3.  Does England move `A Nwy` out or dig in?
